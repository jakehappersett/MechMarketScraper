# /r/MechMarket Scraper

This is a tool that can be utilized to check /r/MechMarket on a time interval and read the post title to search for a keyword. 

If the scraper detects a specified keyword it will send you a text with the post title and a link to the post so you can quickly message the user and ensure you are the first to message them about the keyboard/keyset you are looking for.  

**While this works, it is still in a very early development phase and ideally would not be used until it is more robust**
